# Smart_Home
The project aims to explore the domain of IoT-based smart home automation, coupled with smart garden systems, and automated home security. The motivation lies in the desire to enhance convenience, security, Sustainability, and efficiency in our daily lives. 

This project combines hardware and software components and allows for hands-on experience in integrating various technologies such as Raspberry Pi, networking protocols, various sensors like PIR and soil moisture sensors, and programming languages like Python, and its different libraries, and tools.

This is a smart home system that integrates various appliances, home surveillance, and a smart garden. Through a mobile app, users should be able to control appliances, such as LED bulbs and fans. The system also detects motion with a PIR sensor, activates the living room camera, and sends an email with a 10-second video clip to the owner if someone is detected. Additionally, the system should incorporate a smart garden feature that measures soil moisture and adjusts the water pump intensity based on the moisture level. 

The steps involved were: 
• Create a mobile app with an intuitive user interface to control smart home appliances.  
• Implement functionality in the app to adjust the intensity of LED bulbs and the fan speed.  
• Integrate a PIR sensor to detect motion within the house.  
• Connect a camera inside the living room that activates when motion is detected by the PIR sensor.  
• Integrate an algorithm to distinguish between human and non-human motion in the video feed.  
• Send an alert email to the owner when a person is detected, with a 10-second video clip attached to the mail.  
•Integrate a smart garden system that measures soil moisture levels using a soil moisture sensor.
•Implement a water pump control mechanism that adjusts the intensity or level of water based on the measured moisture level
